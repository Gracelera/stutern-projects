  <!-- <p>NB: Use your heading tags for headings and paragraph tags for the paragraphs. Also format the write-ups with paddings, margins, and borders to beautify them.
The entire write-up should have a background color “white” and it should be in three sections

The first section: Write the heading “First section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain your name and your love for technology. The text color should be green. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px.

The second section: Write the heading “Second section” and comment it out (use 18px). Let it contain what you have learned so far and how css is important. The text color should be red. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px

The third section: Write the heading “Third section” and comment it out (use 18px). Explaining the difference between paddings, margins, and borders. The text color should be blue. Give formatting to it using bold tags and italics tags and the size should be 14px.

  <p class="technology">My name is <strong>Grace Leramo.</strong>
   I love techology because I am fascinated by the power it gives me to build something out of nothing. It's really beautiful to see how much we can <em>build,</em> how much we can <em>create,</em> and how many lives can <em>impact.</em>

  <p class="lessons"> Learning about <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> has been fun. It has been an     eye-opener in the sense that, I have been able to see the possibilities of styling my HTML files and make beautiful interfaces that can appeal to my users. 
  I have learnt how to use <em>max-width,</em>  <em>text-decoration,</em> <em>box-model, etc</em> so far so good, I have been revisiting my old-files to style them better and also practicing so I can get better at it.

  <p class="box-model"> 
    The difference between <strong>paddings, margins, and borders</strong> is: <em>padding</em> exists in between the content and the border. <em>Border</em> exists between margin and padding while <em>Margins</em>  is the outer most layer which exists outside of the border, padding, and content.
